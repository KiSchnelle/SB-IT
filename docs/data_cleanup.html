    <h1>How to Keep Your Data Clean</h1>
    <h2>Clearing Intermediate Results</h2>
    <p>
      It is recommended to use CryoSPARC's built-in feature to clear intermediate results as often as possible.
      This method helps manage storage more efficiently by clearing data on a job-by-job basis instead of having to clear the entire project at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can select and clear multiple jobs at once—typically around 10-15 jobs—by Ctrl-clicking them.
      This is especially beneficial for refinement jobs, which tend to generate a large amount of intermediate data.
      Regularly clearing these results can help free up storage space and maintain optimal system performance.
    </p>
    <p> In Relion you can use the soft clean function to clear intermediate results. </p>
    <h2>Deleting Unproductive Jobs</h2>
    <p>
    Removing jobs that did not yield useful results is a crucial practice for keeping your storage clean and your project organized.
    Deleting these unproductive jobs frees up valuable space and minimizes clutter from unnecessary data.
    </p>
    <p>
    Keep in mind that in Relion, deleted jobs are saved in the Trash folder, so you need to empty the Trash folder regularly to free up storage space.
    </p>
    <p>
    Moreover, by eliminating these jobs, you simplify your processing tree, making it easier to navigate and manage your workflow in future steps.
    </p>
    <h2>Clearing Extract Jobs</h2>
    <p>
    When the extracted particles are no longer needed—such as after completing a project or following a restacking or re-extraction—it is beneficial to clear the extract jobs.
    This process deletes the actual particle data, which can be quite large, while preserving the job skeleton, including the settings.
    </p>
    <p>
    By clearing these jobs, you free up storage space without losing the ability to rerun the extraction if needed.
    This is quite important to keep storage usage as low as possible.
    </p>
    <h2>Deleting imported volumens</h2>
    <p>
      If you have imported volumes that are no longer needed, it is a good practice to delete them. This helps in managing storage effectively and ensures that only relevant data is retained in your project.
      If you imported volumes in cryosparc via drag & drop, you will find them in the imports folder of your project.
      Please clean this folder regularly to avoid unnecessary storage usage.
